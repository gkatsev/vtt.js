// This is a list of all the Unicode characters that have a strong
// right-to-left category. What this means is that these characters are
// written right-to-left for sure. It was generated by pulling all the strong
// right-to-left characters out of the Unicode data table. That table can
// found at: http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt
